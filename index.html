        If you are interested in Japanese ramen noodle soup, the Kanda Misakicho
        area on the south side of JR Suidobashi Station is the place to visit!
        From popular chain stores to unusual ramen specialty shops, there is a
        ramen place on almost every corner of the area. These are our
        recommendations for first-time visitors! “Taitanmen-Senmonten Koishidai”
        offers a rare type of ramen. It’s a mixture of sea bream soup and tantan
        noodles (= spicy noodles with minced meat). Created by a French chef,
        “Taitanmen” noodles is a gem that combines French techniques with
        Japanese ingredients.
