      <h3>The Shin Ramen</h3>
      <p>
        To prepare a delicious bowl of Shin Ramen, start by boiling 550ml (about
        2 1/3 cups) of water in a pot. Once boiling, add the noodles and the
        soup base from the Shin Ramen packet. Stir occasionally and let the
        noodles cook for about 4-5 minutes until they reach your preferred level
        of tenderness. For an enhanced flavor, you can also add a few slices of
        your favorite vegetables like mushrooms, carrots, or spinach during the
        last minute of cooking.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the noodles are cooking, you can prepare some optional toppings to
        make your ramen even more satisfying. Fry an egg sunny-side-up or poach
        it directly in the simmering soup for a protein boost. You can also add
        slices of cooked meat such as beef, pork, or chicken, and garnish with
        chopped green onions, sesame seeds, or a drizzle of sesame oil. Once the
        noodles are cooked, transfer everything to a bowl and enjoy your spicy,
        flavorful Shin Ramen!
