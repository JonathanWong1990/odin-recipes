    <h3>The Mac & Cheese</h3>
    <p>
      Mac and cheese, a classic comfort food, is beloved for its rich, creamy
      texture and satisfying flavor. This dish, typically made with tender elbow
      macaroni enveloped in a velvety cheese sauce, brings warmth and joy to any
      meal. The beauty of mac and cheese lies in its simplicity and versatility;
      whether it's baked with a crispy breadcrumb topping or served straight
      from the stovetop, it never fails to delight. The combination of smooth,
      melted cheese and perfectly cooked pasta creates a harmony of flavors that
      is both nostalgic and indulgent, making it a perennial favorite among both
      children and adults.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes mac and cheese particularly special is its adaptability to
      various tastes and occasions. It can be elevated with gourmet cheeses like
      GruyÃ¨re and Gouda, or kept traditional with a sharp cheddar. Add-ins such
      as bacon, truffle oil, or lobster can transform it into a luxurious dish
      fit for special occasions. Despite these potential variations, the essence
      of mac and cheese remains comfortingly familiar. Its ability to be both a
      quick weeknight meal and a star at holiday feasts showcases its universal
      appeal. Simply put, mac and cheese is a testament to the joy of simple,
      hearty food that brings people together with its delightful taste and
      comforting presence.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        8 oz (225g) elbow macaroni 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese 1/4 cup
        unsalted
      </li>
      <li>
        butter 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 cups milk (whole milk recommended)
        1/2
      </li>
      <li>
        teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 1/4 teaspoon paprika (optional)
      </li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Follow These Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the Pasta: </strong>Bring a large pot of salted water to a
        boil. Add the elbow macaroni and cook according to the package
        instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Make the Roux: </strong>
        In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add
        the flour and whisk continuously for about 2 minutes until the mixture
        is bubbly and smooth, forming a roux.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Cheese Sauce:</strong>
        Gradually add the milk to the roux, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.
        Continue to cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 5-7 minutes.
        Once thickened, reduce the heat to low and stir in the shredded cheddar
        cheese, salt, pepper, and paprika. Continue stirring until the cheese is
        completely melted and the sauce is smooth.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Combine Pasta and Cheese Sauce:</strong>
        Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until the pasta is
        fully coated with the sauce. If using, stir in the grated Parmesan
        cheese for extra flavor.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong>
        Serve the mac and cheese immediately while it's hot and creamy.
        Optionally, you can transfer it to a baking dish, sprinkle with
        breadcrumbs, and bake in a preheated oven at 350Â°F (175Â°C) for 20
        minutes to achieve a crispy top.
